    <h1>   Minion Maker: my first project. This was really fun to play with because I could choose what I wanted to customize on the minion. It was satisfying to see the project finished as well. I had the most trouble with importing the banana picture into VS Code, because I didn't know how to do it at first. I finally figured out that for the image to be a turtle shape, the image has to be a gif. I'm proud of how the project turned out overall. </h1>

    <h1>   Dino Game: the objective of the game is to collect as many coins as you can in the time period while avoiding the obstacles. It was a fun game to make, but it was hard to figure out collisions. </h1>

    <h1>   Dot Parkour: we made this game on scratch. Scratch was easier to work with because it was block code, and I felt like I was better equipped to customize game mechanics the way I wanted it to. Adding sounds, animations, and movement was much easier to code. I really like how the end product came out to be, with the different themes and maps. </h1>
